# rira-currency-converter

React Currency Converter App
This is a simple currency converter application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, and the layout is adapted for right-to-left (RTL) languages like Persian.

Key Features
Real-time Conversion: Converts amounts between Dollar and Rial as you type.

RTL Layout: The entire application uses a right-to-left layout for a natural user experience.

Vazirmatn Font: A suitable and clean font for Persian typography has been integrated.

Type Safety: The project uses TypeScript to ensure code is robust and easy to maintain.

Note on Exchange Rate
For the purpose of this demo application, the exchange rate is a fixed constant (1,050,000). This was done to simplify the project and focus on the core concepts of React, state management, and Tailwind CSS.

In a production environment, this value would be fetched from a real-time currency exchange API to provide accurate and up-to-date conversion rates. The use of a fixed value here demonstrates a fundamental understanding of how data flows in a React application without introducing the complexity of network requests and API handling.

##References
We made use of packages and libraries documentations such as Tailwindcss, React and TypeScript for implementing this project.
